# Ng2TicTacToe

This is a demo project for unbeatable TicTacToe Game, it's developed by Minimax algorithm and supports up to 5x5 boards

## To Run the Project

Run `npm install -g ionic cordova` then `ionic serve`

## Issues

- it has some performance issues with large boards as it take sometime to build the decision tree
- i haven't developed the flag to say that the game is over, when the AI wins , it stops playing and also in cases of draw , i don't raise a message
